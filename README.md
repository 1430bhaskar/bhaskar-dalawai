# Gift Guide (Shopify)

This repository contains the code for a custom Shopify section designed to create an interactive "Gift Guide" on an e-commerce store. The section features a responsive top banner, a dynamic product grid, and a quick-add modal for a seamless shopping experience.

---

### Features

* **Responsive Top Bar**: A sticky header with a logo, a promotional message, and a call-to-action (CTA) button. It transforms into a mobile-friendly hamburger menu that reveals a slide-down panel.
* **Dynamic Hero Banner**: A customizable, full-width hero image with an overlay for a title, subheading, and a main CTA.
* **Interactive Product Grid**: Displays a selection of products as image-only cards. Clicking a card opens a modal for quick-add functionality.
* **Quick-Add Modal**: A modal that fetches product data via JavaScript to display options (colors, sizes) and allows customers to add items to their cart without leaving the page.
* **Upsell Logic**: Includes a feature to automatically add a bonus product to the cart when a specific variant (e.g., "Black" and "Medium") is selected.
* **Clean & Maintainable Code**: The CSS is cleaned up and consolidated to remove redundancy. The JavaScript is modular, separating UI logic from data fetching.
